From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This was my first significant front-end project.

I started by adding the Google image on the site and the Google icon in the tab section, followed up by adding the search bar.
Then i started to search about the positioning of the Google image and the search bar.
At start was kind of difficult but as I moved on, i started to get a hold on the project.
After i modified the position and the style of the search bar (using developer tools and inspiring from the Google.com itself) I started to make the top navbar.
After that, I created the buttons(where i had some positioning them in the center of the page) and then I moved on to the footer section.
This is where i had the biggest problems and where I learned the most out of this project. Here, I played with the CSS styling, trying to make the unordered list look good on the footer section. After some tweaks and some searches on the google, I finally made it through.

Some big things that I learned through this project: how to organise your html pages; how to work with browser dev tools; how to stylise the elemnts of HTML using CSS.
